# BongoPod

A desktop app for managing your local containers driven by Docker/Podman. Made with electron, pug, stylus and pure frustration of using Docker's and Podman's CLI.

It is not made for any enterprise-gradey stuff, it just helps manage those containers while you develop a new containerized app.
